iOS inspired theme for Kodi/XBMC. Designed for mobile devices.

Installation: Download this theme by clicking the "Download ZIP" button on this repo's main page. Unzip and drop the main folder into your Kodi addons folder. For iOS this folder is located at /Applications/Kodi.app/AppData/AppHome/addons. Next simply open Kodi, go to Settings > Appearance and enable the iOSinspired skin.

For code contributors (thank you!) all of the main changes are in the files 720p/VideoOSD.xml and 720p/VideoFullScreen.xml as well as the added images in /media and therefore /media/Textures.xbt. Everything else is basically Confluence source code at this point. Somewhere down the line it would be nice to extend this theme's touch and smartphone friendliness to other parts of the interface, but that might be asking for too much.

Enjoy!
