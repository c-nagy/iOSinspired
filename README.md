Skin preview: https://i.imgur.com/n9vAZqK.jpg

iOS inspired theme for Kodi/XBMC. Designed for mobile devices.

If you would just like to use this skin and not make any changes to the images, etc. you can just delete everything except for Textures.xbt from the 'media' folder, drop the main 'skin.iOSinspired' folder into your addons folder and you'll be good to go!

For code contributors (thank you!) all of the main changes are in the files /720p/VideoOSD.xml and /720p/VideoFullScreen.xml as well as the added images in /media and therefore /media/Textures.xbt

Enjoy!
